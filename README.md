# mandelbrot-generator
The base code for a mandelbrot set generator that I'm currently working on. 
I plan to implement a curses UI and a customizable color palette for the escape values.
Currently, the output is in ppm because of the ease of implementation. This is subject to change. 

Included is an alternative implementation of the same code, which is able to generate and output julia sets.

# ADDENDUM: The ncurses UI is finished and ready for use. It incorporates both implementations of the old code in one easy to use package.

# Still to be done:
-Frame capture, zoom and video/gif output
-batch generation of julia sets
-better code documentation/clean-up
