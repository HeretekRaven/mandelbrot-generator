# mandelbrot-generator
The base code for a mandelbrot set generator that I'm currently working on. 
I plan to implement a curses UI and a customizable color palette for the escape values.
Currently, the output is in ppm because of the ease of implementation. This is subject to change. 

Included is an alternative implementation of the same code, which is able to generate and output julia sets.
